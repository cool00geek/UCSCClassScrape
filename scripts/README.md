# UCSC Class Scrape Scripts

This folder will contain all scripts I have used to analyze the data acquired by scraping the class search page. See the table to see if any script matches your needs

| Script Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `remote_instruction.py` | List all classes that have the instruction as remote learning (not accounting for labs) |
| `in_person.py` | List all classes that have the instruction meeting location not as remote or online |
| `hybrid.py` | List all classes that have the discussion meeting location not as remote or online, but the main meeting is |
| `combined.py` | List all classes that are combined with other classes (different name/dept, but taught together) |
